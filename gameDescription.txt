I will make a game where the goal is to turn all of the LED's off. 
LED's are switched on and off by pressing buttons. 
The player will have to find an order of pressing the buttons to turn off all of the LED's.
 
The game will be possible to complete because when the game is run, a random sequence of the buttons will be virtually pressed. 
This will result in some combination of on and off LED's.


----ALSO----

In the qemu, there are two .py files that if you type them, their program will start running.

They are located in "buildroot-2021.02/output/target/usr/bin/"


switch0_read_irq.py

and

# I believe this is set to 18 for now.
button13_read_irq.py
